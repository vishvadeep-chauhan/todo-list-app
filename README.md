# todo-list-app
When you open the HTML file in a web browser, you will see a simple to-do list app interface. You can enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task" or press Enter to add it to the list. 
Click on a task to mark it as completed (the task will have a line-through style) or double-click on a task to remove it from the list.
